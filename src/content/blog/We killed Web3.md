Hey, do you remember the web3 hype? It was all over the news and social media a year ago. Everyone was talking about how web3 was going to revolutionize the internet and create a new era of innovation and prosperity. There were countless startups launching web3 projects and raising millions of dollars from investors. They claimed that web3 was the future of the web and that blockchain was the magic ingredient that made it possible.

But what happened to all that excitement and promise? Why do we still see the same old web2 applications dominating the online space? Why haven’t we witnessed the amazing benefits of blockchain in our daily lives? If you are a web3 developer, you might be partly responsible for this disappointing outcome. Let me explain why.

Web3 is based on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records transactions and data in a secure, transparent and immutable way. Blockchain has some incredible features that can enable new kinds of applications and services that are not possible or feasible with web2. For example, blockchain can facilitate peer-to-peer payments, digital identity, smart contracts, decentralized governance, tokenization and more.

But these features are not useful or relevant for most of the application they used to create in the web3 tutorials. In fact, they can be counterproductive or detrimental in some cases. For instance, why would you need blockchain for a social media platform? Is it for security? Well, security can be achieved with traditional technologies as well, and blockchain does not prevent hacking or bugs. Is it for transparency? Well, transparency can be a double-edged sword, as it can expose sensitive or personal information to anyone who can access the ledger. Is it for decentralization? Well, decentralization can come at a cost of efficiency, scalability and user experience.

By trying to force blockchain into applications that don’t need it or benefit from it, we are wasting its potential and diluting its value. We are also creating unnecessary complexity and friction for users and developers. We are missing the point of web3, which is not to replace web2, but to complement it and enhance it with new possibilities.

So, what should we do instead? We should focus on the problems that blockchain can actually solve or improve. We should leverage its strengths and avoid its weaknesses. We should use it where it makes sense and adds value. We should think of web3 as a tool, not a goal.

For example, can you imagine any other technology that can enable fast and cheap cross-border payments without intermediaries and low fees, web3 could make it happen. Just think about any technology other than blockchain, that lets you store important information like password or documents privately and securely. Don’t play using Web3 in the battlefield of web2, Web3 has its own unique powers, which no other current technologies have. So, stop using blockchain as a buzzword and try to utilize its power only if it adds value to the software.
